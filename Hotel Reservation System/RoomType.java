// This code snippet is defining an enumeration type in Java called `RoomType`. The enumeration
// consists of three constants: `STANDARD`, `JUNIOR`, and `MASTER`. Enumerations are used to define a
// set of named constants, making the code more readable and maintainable by providing a way to
// represent a fixed set of values.
public enum RoomType {
    STANDARD, JUNIOR, MASTER
}
